#HTML

By the end of these exercises, I'm hoping that you'll have a solid handle on HTML fundamentals, HTML5 semantic elements, forms, and good practices for web layouts.

Each HTML file in this folder will have a URL at the top.

Depending on your schedule and how thorough you choose to be, I'd anticipate that this will take you from 1-2 weeks to complete. Go into as much or as little detail as you like on the HTML - the point of these is for you to be thinking in HTML, not for you to have lots of practice copy/pasting the same elements over and over again.

Commit your work often. When you're ready for a review, submit a pull request and I'll get back to you!

We'll be revisiting some of these when we get to the CSS section.

Good luck!
