I designed and built this site for my friends!
Pretty straightforward layout. The trick on this one is going to be the nav bar that sticks at the top of the screen after you scroll.
That functionality is handled via javascript, but I want to see how you will roll out the HTML anyhow.

    <h2>"Here comes Trouble."</h2>
    <article class="inline-block">
      <p>
        <span class="enlarge-font">HIM</span> BY HER</p>
      <p>Collin grew up in Sumner. At the age of 18 he moved to Seattle, attended University of Washington, graduated, and began working at Greenlake Bar & Grill. He is a little older than Caitlin, but found himself inexplicably drawn to the 19 year-old
        hostess. Through all his attempts to impress her, from frosting the tips of his hair to driving her around in his green Accord, it was his love for literature that really caught Caitlin's attention. That and his sweet, sweet dance moves.</p>
      <p>Over the next three years of long-distance, Collin began law school at Seattle University. He moved apartments, drove to Canada countless times, and was a very patient man. Finally, with Collin's level-headed guidance, they signed a lease on their
        Fremont apartment in 2010. The next stretch of time was a trying one for poor Collin. He was finishing law school, shredded his knee ligaments, took the bar exam, and found a job - while tolerating Caitlin during her first years of graduate school.
        He also, despite his best efforts, fell madly in love with two kittens and convinced Caitlin to let him bring them home.</p>
      <p>Now, for the first time, Caitlin and Collin are both out of school. Collin walks to the bus stop and takes public transportation to his grown up job, like the adult that he is! He is training for his second round of the Tough Mudder challenge, remains
        a dedicated nightly reader, and volunteers at a community legal clinic.</p>

        <span class="enlarge-font">HER</span> BY HIM</p>
      <p>Caitlin grew up in Seattle. And when I say Seattle, I mean she is a city girl through and through. When I told her I grew up in Sumner, she very seriously asked "Oh, is that near Olympia?"</p>
      <p>Caitlin and I met while we were both working at the Greenlake Bar & Grill. At the time, she was working on her undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, B.C. She had a blast in college, and she met some fantastic friends
        who we still love to visit as often as we are able. Caitlin obtained her Master's Degree from Seattle Pacific University and now works as a therapist, helping people every day.</p>
      <p>When not saving the world, Caitlin loves to cook and invent new dishes, figure out who the perp is on Law & Order SVU, hunt down the best deal or perfect gift, and spoil her kitties. She humors my love of all things sport, but I think she would
        admit she actually enjoys Sounders games in the summer time. But don't let her fool you into thinking she's not athletic, in just the last couple of years she summited Mount Rainier and ran a half-marathon, and she is currently prepping for her
        first Tough Mudder.</p>

      <h2>"Do you have any idea how many rings I've looked at?"</h2>
      <h2>THE PROPOSAL</h2>
      <p>In March 2013, after nearly 7 years together, Caitlin and Collin traveled back to the island of Kauai, the site of their very first vacation together years ago. Before leaving town, Collin took Caitlin's dad, Ben, out for scotch(es) to ask permission
        to marry his daughter. While he had planned the proposal for quite some time, Caitlin had become suspicious. Collin had to assure her there would absolutely not be a proposal of any kind on the trip, and stop asking. Somehow, Caitlin accepted
        this, likely because she was so excited to go on a tropical vacation!</p>
      <p>And so, one morning while the time change still had them waking up before dawn, Caitlin and Collin crept down to the lava rocks over the ocean to watch the sunrise and drink Kahlua and coffee. The air was chilly, and Caitlin quickly curled up in
        a towel and sat down to ponder the universe. Through multiple awkward yet effective diversionary tactics, Collin finally convinced her to stand back up so that he could get down on one knee and propose.</p>
      <p>"Collin, do you remember what you said?"</p>
      <p>"No. Words. Words and words and ahhhh don't drop this thing in the rocks or water where we can't find it."</p>
      <img class="inline-block" src="http://img.mota.ru/upload/wallpapers/source/2011/04/11/10/02/25043/mota_ru_1041116.jpg" alt="Beach people" width="300">
      <p>Well, Caitlin thought it was romantic nonetheless.</p>
      <p>With the sun rising over the ocean, whales breaching in unison in the distance, and turtles swimming in the surf below, Caitlin said yes! And after she was able to breathe again, and the tears and shaking stopped, they kissed - and lived happily
        ever after.</p>

    <article class="inline-block">
      <h2>4:00<sup><small>PM</small></sup>, NOVEMBER 15, 2014</h2>
      <p>This afternoon ceremony and reception will take place at the same location in Seattle's historic Pioneer Square neighborhood, right in downtown Seattle. We chose this location for a few reasons. First of all, because it is breathtaking, soulful,
        and perfectly sized. It is also the previous site of the Elliot Bay Bookstore, which we were both raised to love.</p>

      <p>Now refurbished by Urban Light Studios, Axis is a killer modernized venue, but with the age and emotion of something more substantial. Look for fun touches, like the markings on the floor or the paper towel holders in the restrooms. A note: we feel
        so blessed to have so many loved ones that we will be tight on space, but due to that that, any dates or guests not named on the invitation must be cleared with us at time of RSVP. Also, while we love children, we ask that you leave yours at home
        for the night. Thank you!</p>
