#Layout 2

Oh shit here it goes!

Make this screenshot happen. Once again, I have provided the HTML for you, and a pre-separated CSS file, but you'll have to add the CSS classes yourself this time!

Try to get as far as you can in three days - so if you start Monday morning, end of day Wednesday.

The potato believes in you. I do not. I expect you to fail. I want you to fail so you get frustrated and start asking questions, because asking questions all the time is totally how programming works IRL. 

Good luck!
