#CSS

Now for the less fun part!

Conceptually, I think CSS is a bit harder. You have to know your tools, think about inheritance, and approach things with much more of a programmer's mindset than the simple declarative nature of HTML. As a result, where you were able to accomplish the HTML section pretty quickly, I anticipate that this will take much longer. I'm not sure how many exercises I'll drop in here.

By the end of this, I want you to have the confidence to approach nearly any static page, comp, or design, and know that you can build it. We won't be getting into advanced CSS techniques, such as complex animations or SVG, since you can't really get far there without some Javascript anyway.

In contrast to the HTML section, this section will have each exercise separated into its own folder.

##Notes

*Spend some time getting to know your dev tools.* The more you know your way around them, the faster you will go. Coding all your CSS in a text editor without looking at the actual page while you do it is something to aspire to, not something to start with. 

Good luck!
