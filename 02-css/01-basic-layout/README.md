#Basic Layout

After some thought regarding past challenges, I decided to go with sketches and mockups for the start of the CSS section. With a complex, real-world site, it's really easy to get mired in details that aren't actually the intended focus of the challenge. With a mockup, it's easier to focus on bigger picture things, such as page structure and layout.


Build the screenshot, using floats as your primary method. Floats are, in many ways, on their way to being obsolete, but they're still just about everywhere on the web, so it's a good thing to know how to deal with their weirdness.

##UPDATE

I've updated this folder with a new kind of challenge. Having to think about all the different things at once muddies the water a bit, and obfuscates the parts I want you to focus on, so I'm changing the exercise.

In this folder, you'll find three files: index.html, style.css, and screenshot2.png. Your task is to update style.css and ONLY style.css to make it look like the screenshot (more or less). 

I want you to finish this by end of day tomorrow (Feb 17). 

Also! Once you get this, I want you to add a note in the README here that says you got it, commit, and open a pull request. Set a timer for yourself. Every hour you work on it, I want you to commit whatever you've got, and push it up into the PR where I can see it.

It's scary! It's pressure! But it's ok, it's only me. If you have a question in particular, ping me on IM, or add @mgamini in one of your hourly commits, and I'll get a notification. 

Get only as far as you can. There is no way to fail, this is all for you.
